A Wordle clone with a social twist, built using Google Colab for easy access.

* Slide word_size to choose the number of letters

* Slide number_attempts to choose the number of tries you get

* The answer is tied to game_code, so if you use the same code as a friend, you'll both be guessing the same answer. Type in "RANDOM" to get a random word.
